# CVbuilder

This is a CV builder that I have created using Vite and React. Including packages such as React-router and Reactpdf.

## How to use

The landing page is a series of forms, requiring standard information which would be expected in a CV. The forms are monitored by React code updating state as they are being filled out. The preview page can be accessed in the Navbar above and directs the user to a preview of the PDF, using the information provided in the forms. The colors of the name as well as the header titles can be changed using the color pad on the left. The pdf can be downloaded either using the download button, or simply from the previewer.
