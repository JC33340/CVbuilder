# CVbuilder

This is a CV builder that I have created using Vite, running React. Including packages such as React-router and Reactpdf.

The 2 pages, preview page and form page are separated and navigation is directed using React-router. All the form information is held by state and updated simultaneously with user input. This information is being maintained in a parent level which is then used to render the PDF upon loading of the preview page.

## How to use

Enter data into forms, which will automatically update the preview page. Producing a downloadable PDF, there is also a color pad on the left hand side allowing the user the change the color of the name or of the the section titles. PDF can be downloaded either via the viewer, or using the download button at the top of the page.
